# DEX pools and token bridging from ETH to NYM chain - using the cosmos gravity bridge

Recommended for anyone with a bit more experience in DEFI tools - and who’s looking for DEX alternatives to buying tokens CEX-es, or for those who don’t use Kraken but any other CEX that has NYM erc-20 listings  

1. Swap some NYM (erc-20) on [Uniswapp](https://app.uniswap.org).

**There are two pools atm:**

* [NYM - ETH](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x1c774b48cd31dcf9fcb4bbb8ff52a8c4b4094c3d) 
* [NYM - USDT](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xdd1f66d14d1c7e114b2cf06da92430e92d14334f)

🔥 If you are an **OG DEFI🧙  you can consider supporting the project by providing liquidity in the Uniswapp pools 🫀**
