Like a well-mixed tropical fruit salad, the individuals who make up Pineapple Proxy each have a mysterious mix of skills, depth, and worldly insight. From hackers and writers to activists, strategists, programmers and artists (and a few hidden talents). These individuals make it a dream to collaborate with, especially since everyone has insight into various social movements and industries that span across privacy technology.

Our team is distributed, self-organising and culturally diverse. 
We come from all around the world: 🇨🇭🇩🇪🇨🇿🇭🇺🇮🇷🇦🇺🇺🇦🇦🇹🇵🇹🇪🇸🇺🇸
