We are🍍

: exploring new ways of hive-like cooperation, and localised network states
: experimenting with novel ways of empowerment through technologies for communities who need it the most
: weaving play, light and empathy into our collective narratives
: building a syndicate of builders of a collaborative future.

Creating🍍🍍

: content, stories and metaphors 
: accessibilty for masses to new internet technologies
: shared experiences, language and symbols enabling empowerment and emergence
: trustless and private tools and solutions for collaboration
: prototyping tokenised structures of trust 

Hopeful bedtime stories for an adolescent hive-mind. 
Manifesting shared dreams that shape our tomorrow.
