From hackers and writers to activists, strategists, programmers and artists (and a few hidden talents).
These individuals make it a dream to collaborate with, especially since everyone has insight into various social movements and industries that span across privacy technology.


Our team is distributed, self-organising and culturally diverse.

We come from all around the world:🇮🇷🇦🇺🇭🇺🇨🇭🇺🇦🇦🇹🇵🇹🇰🇪
