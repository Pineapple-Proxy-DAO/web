## The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto

Date: 1988

> Cypherpunks of the World,
> 
> Several of you at the "physical Cypherpunks" gathering yesterday in Silicon Valley requested that more of the material passed out in meetings be available electronically to the entire readership of the Cypherpunks list, spooks, eavesdroppers, and all. <Gulp>
> 
> Here's the "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" I read at the September 1992 founding meeting. It dates back to mid-1988 and was distributed to some like-minded techno-anarchists at the "Crypto '88" conference and then again at the "Hackers Conference" that year. I later gave talks at Hackers on this in 1989 and 1990.

> There are a few things I'd change, but for historical reasons I'll just leave it as is. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to you...I hope the Crypto Glossary I just distributed will help.

## A Cypherpunk's Manifesto

Date: 1993

> Written in 1991 by Eric Hughes, a professor at the University of Berkley, the crypherpunk manifesto was written in the early days of the internet. The cypherpunks were visionaries while their core belief was that the Internet would soon become an important battleground for human freedom. And they were right.
>
> Reading the cypherpunkâ€™s manifesto, a defacto declaration of independence for the right to privacy, it is not hard to understand why it has been a big influence on cryptography in general and Bitcoin in particular.

##  A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

Date: 1996 

> The declaration sets out, in sixteen short paragraphs, a rebuttal to government of the Internet by any outside force, specifically the United States. It states that the United States did not have the consent of the governed to apply laws to the Internet, and that the Internet was outside any country's borders. Instead, the Internet was developing its own social contracts to determine how to handle its problems, based on the golden rule. It does this in language evocative of the United States Declaration of Independence and obliquely cites it in its final paragraphs. Although the paper mentions the Telecommunications Act, it also accuses China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, and Italy of stifling the Internet.

## LunarDAO manifesto
  
Date: 2022
  
 > Privacy is for the people, to prevent the agents of power from intruding in the innermost parts of our existence. Transparency must apply to those in power, to lay open their machinations and hold them accountable. This includes any government, supranational entity, corporations and conglomerates. Crypto-advocates are being denounced as criminal and terrorist, co-opted, marginalized and violently crushed. The existing establishment only maintains and intensifies our enslavement.
>
> We, the people, must create new worlds to live a free life.

  ## Cyphernox Manifesto

Date: 2023
