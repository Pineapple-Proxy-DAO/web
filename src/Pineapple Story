We are a community, a syndicate, a decentralised tropical garden party that is driven by collective visions of a future, built on cooperation, empathy, transparency and honesty.

We believe in things that unite us, tools that create equality and new socioeconomic models that are inclusive.  

This is a shared experience beyond our present, conscious horizon: in a place what we reach by learning and growing together.

05.01.23 - Dear Pineapples: Remember how you once were a tired, paranoid, frantic hacker? Remember the stir of thoughts that pulled you down, the grey skies outside, the worry of all the things around you dissolving? Now, you have awakened to your great, zesty taste. The colour has returned to the skies and the faces around you. All kinds of fruits, cherries and watermelons, grapes and dragonfruit. Wow. The magic of this world wasn't hidden in all the sci-fi you were reading. It was right here, within you, all along. Wake up, dear pineapple, to the magic flavours in you. Though not everyone is a hacker doodle dude like you sweet friend, your gifts are needed in this world. There are all kinds of delicious fruits and critters out there -- your adventure ahead awaits, do it with love and an open heart. 💖✨🍍
07.01.23 - Opened up the open library of Undystopian Alexandria 🍍 As passionate cypherpunks and zesty fruits living in this current, historic age -- we felt compelled to start creating a library of future commons. We believe that through books full of stories and ideas, we can amplify the potential of our shared dreams about a future, where privacy is a fundamental human right. Shared words and vocabulary are the brick and mortar for projects that we might build together. At this point in time, knowledge is scattered and everybody is naturally interested in so many different things. Science-fiction, research papers, and other types of books are a great way to explore different angles that we can take, while leaning into a shared future.
15.01.23 - The collection of undystopian manifestos is online
01.02.23 - Launch of Pineapple Citadelle (a BTC multisig) and Pineapple Express (an EU LLC), to enable both on-chain and FIAT value flows.
