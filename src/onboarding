ALL FRUITS ARE WELCOME IN PINEAPPLE PROXY

There are no gates, security or ID check at our decentralised tropical garden party. 
Everything is built on trust, mutual respect, and engagement. 

The onboarding process is really simple:
1) Familiarise yourself with the tropifunk vibes and tribe. Have a look around here or have a chat with one of us!
2) If you decide you're ready, join the 🍍 telegram group
2) And if you feel like it, come and hang out with us on our weekly town hall: Thursdays at 18.00 (subject to change) - to receive 🍍POAP
3) Engage and co-create the next steps together with us!
